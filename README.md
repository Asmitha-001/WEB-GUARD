📌 WebGuard - Intelligent Spam Shield via Machine Learning Chrome Extension
WebGuard is an intelligent browser extension that delivers real-time, adaptive spam filtration powered by a dynamic ensemble of machine learning models. As spam techniques evolve rapidly, WebGuard offers a scalable, transparent, and self-learning approach to content hygiene across websites and digital platforms.

🚀 Key Innovations
🧠 Multi-Model Fusion Engine
Utilizes a synergistic blend of Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and Random Forest classifiers to maximize detection precision and minimize false positives.

🔍 Context-Aware Spam Analysis
Dynamically inspects visible on-page content, analyzing text at the sentence-level granularity to catch nuanced and disguised spam.

🟥 Real-Time Spam Visualizer
Automatically highlights suspicious content with red overlays, providing immediate visual cues without disrupting the user experience.

🧾 Intelligent Input Scanner
A built-in scanner area enables users to manually submit messages or comments from any platform to check for potential spam threats in real-time.

⚡ Instantaneous Detection Pipeline
Integrated with your browser session to run low-latency, on-the-fly classifications as you navigate web content.

♻️ Self-Evolving Spam Defense
Continuously trains on fresh data patterns, ensuring resilience against novel and evolving spam strategies.

🎛️ Intuitive Control Panel
A minimalistic interface allows users to fine-tune sensitivity, toggle models, and view detection confidence, offering transparency and customization.

💡 Why WebGuard?
In the age of information overload, users are increasingly vulnerable to deceptive, harmful, or irrelevant content. Traditional spam filters are often reactive, platform-dependent, and slow to adapt.

WebGuard stands out by:

Bringing ML-based spam detection directly into the browser

Empowering users to detect, visualize, and respond to spam in real time

Offering a plug-and-play solution without requiring technical knowledge

This project pioneers a cross-platform spam interception layer that redefines how end-users defend against digital spam threats.
